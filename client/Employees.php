Generally, fewer and fewer employees have clicked on links in malicious emails or have forfeited their credentials.  The graph below shows employee responses to each campaign in chronological order.</p><img src="/img/overview_graph.png" style="width: 90%;"><br><p>The evident improvements show that employees are becoming aware of the dangers of phishing and are now, for the most part, on the lookout for potential scams. The next planned phishing scheme has fewer red flags and will therefore be harder to identify. Based on the past data, we believe that your employees will still perform above average for a firm of this size.</p><svg width="90%" height="3%" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 480 4"><line x1="30" y1="0" x2="450" y2="0" style="stroke:#3f0f91;stroke-width:3" /></svg></div>
