Beginning on Thursday, July 12, emails were sent from these accounts under the pretense of a job search.</p><img src="/img/resumes_email.png" style="width: 90%;"><br><p>Instead of an attached pdf, these fraudulent emails included png files that were linked to a spoofed Google login page, hosted on an Asio server rather than the intended Google subdomain. This login page prompted the targets to enter their email account passwords. After complying, the targets were then redirected to the resumes they initially believed they were clicking on. Below is an example of one of the spoofed login pages.</p><img src="/img/resumes_site.png" style="width: 90%;"><br><p>Note the highlighted URL bar of the spoofed Google login page; although the site is fraudulent, analysts enabled https to make the site appear to be secure. Upon closer inspection, however, a potential victim can discern that the site they are visiting is not a subdomain of Google, but instead hosted at <i>directssmtp.ddns.net</i> rather than <i>accounts.google.com.</i></p><svg width="90%" height="3%" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 480 4"><line x1="30" y1="0" x2="450" y2="0" style="stroke:#3f0f91;stroke-width:3" /></svg></div>
